# Reading List App

Hello! This project was inspired by a problem I face in my life - keeping track of the books I've read and the books I 
want to read in the future. It is also an opportunity for me to solidify the skills I have learned with new technologies.

The technologies used in this project include Java, Spring Boot, Docker and MongoDB. The aim is to combine these to create
an application where I could create, read, update and delete different items on a list of books.
